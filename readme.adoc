Basic scala collections performance benchmark from Li Haoyi updated for
scala 2.12

See his https://www.lihaoyi.com/post/BenchmarkingScalaCollections.html[blog post] for 2.11

To run the performance test::
`sbt "bench/runMain bench.Performance [repeat loops] [result file]"`

or

`gradle run [repeat loops] [result file]`

To run the memory test::
`sbt "bench/runMain bench.Memory"`

or

`gradle run -Pbench=Memory

=== Changes
- do not initialize test case @ each execution
- do not run initialization for 2sec before test case execution

=== Added features
- repetition can be passed as main program argument to PerfMain (defaulted to 7)
- array and buffer indexing extracted from "lookup" benchmark into: "index"
- grade build added
