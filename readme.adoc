Basic scala collections performance benchmark from Li Haoyi updated for
scala 2.12

See his https://www.lihaoyi.com/post/BenchmarkingScalaCollections.html[blog post] for 2.11

To run the performance test::
`sbt "bench/runMain bench.Performance [repeat loops] [result file]"`

or

`gradle run --args='<repeat loops> [result file]'`

To run the memory test::
`sbt "bench/runMain bench.Memory"`

or

`gradle run -Pbench=Memory`

Note:: gradle run does not find the agent TODO: Fix `applicationDefaultJvmArgs`

=== Changes
- do not initialize test case @ each execution
- do not run initialization for 2sec before test case execution
- removed ammonite dependency

=== Added features
- repetition can be passed as main program argument to `Performance` benchmark (defaulted to 7)
- array and buffer indexing extracted from "lookup" benchmark into: "index"
- grade build added
- `Analyze` can take the result file name as command line parameter
- benchmark case 'Set' 'concat' uses unique values
