Basic scala collections performance benchmark from Li Haoyi updated for
scala 2.12

See his https://www.lihaoyi.com/post/BenchmarkingScalaCollections.html[blog post] for 2.11

To run the performance test::
`sbt "bench/runMain bench.PerfMain [repeat loops]"`

To run the memory test::
`sbt "bench/runMain bench.MemoryMain"`

=== Added features
- repetition can be passed as main program argument to PerfMain (defaulted to 7)
- array and buffer indexing extracted from "lookup" benchmark into: "index"
